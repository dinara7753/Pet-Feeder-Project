To prepare for presenting my automated pet feeder project, I asked Copilot to help me write a professional README.md file that clearly communicates the purpose, functionality, and structure of my solution. My prompt was:
“Can you help me write a professional README.md file that summarizes my project for presentation?”
Copilot responded with a well-organized template that included sections such as Project Overview, Features, System Flow, Technologies Used, Setup Instructions and Future Improvements. It emphasized clarity and conciseness, helping me articulate the problem I was solving, ensuring consistent and monitored feeding for shelter animals and how my system addressed it through timed dispensing, sensor feedback, and alert mechanisms.
One key improvement was Copilot’s suggestion to include a visual flowchart and sample input/output scenarios to make the README more engaging and informative. It also helped me refine my language to sound more professional and confident, which was especially useful for the presentation context.
This guidance shaped both my written documentation and verbal explanation making my project easier to understand for evaluators and peers. I’ve included screenshots of this interaction to show how Copilot’s structured approach helped me elevate the quality of my final presentation materials.
