Test Case	                      Process	                                       Output
Pet eats as expected	          Dispense Portion Size, Food Eaten	             Output Record
Pet does not eat	              Dispense Portion Size, Food Not Eaten        	 Send Alert
Food bin is empty	              System canâ€™t dispense food	                   Send Alert

Discussion of logic

1.	The logic works for pet eating and not eating scenarios.
2.	It sends alerts when food is not eaten.
3.	It sends alerts when bin is empty.

Refinements
1.	Add low food sensor.
2.	Improve alert system to SMS instead of local alerts.
