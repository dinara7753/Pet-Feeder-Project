While refining my automated pet feeder system, I asked Copilot to suggest alternative approaches to improve the logic of my flowchart. My prompt was:
“Can you help me explore different ways to solve this problem or enhance the logic of my flowchart?”
Copilot responded with several creative and practical suggestions. It proposed using a decision tree structure to simplify conditional logic, integrating sensor feedback loops to dynamically adjust feeding portions, and adding a fail-safe mechanism in case of hardware malfunction. One standout idea was to implement a modular design where each function timing, portion control, monitoring, and alerting could be independently tested and updated. This helped me visualize the system as a set of interdependent but flexible components.
Another enhancement was the use of color-coded flowchart branches to distinguish between normal operations and error-handling paths. This made the diagram more intuitive and easier to debug. Copilot also recommended simulating edge cases, such as missed feedings or sensor errors, to ensure the system behaves predictably.
These insights encouraged me to rethink my initial linear design and adopt a more adaptive, fault-tolerant structure. I’ve included screenshots of this exchange to show how Copilot’s suggestions directly influenced my improved flowchart.
