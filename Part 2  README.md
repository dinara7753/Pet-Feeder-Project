# Pet-Feeder-Project
A low-cost, programmable automated pet feeder system designed for animal shelters and pet owners. The feeder dispenses food at scheduled times, monitors food consumption, and alerts staff if the pet does not eat within a given time.

This project simulates the logic behind an *Automatic Pet Feeder System*, designed using flowcharts and sequential logic planning.

## Overview
The project demonstrates how to solve a real-world problem using algorithm design techniques. A detailed flowchart was created in draw.io to visualize the system's logic for scheduled food dispensing, ensuring pets are fed automatically at specific times.

## Tools Used
- *draw.io*: Used to design the system's logic through flowcharts.
- *Microsoft Word*: Used to document the problem-solving process and implementation plan.
-*Capilot: Used to enhance the documentation.

## File Structure
- flowchart.drawio: Flowchart diagram of the pet feeder logic.
- solution.docx: Word document outlining the problem, planning, and step-by-step implementation.
